# **Document-Based Chatbot with Streamlit and Cohere**

This project is a document-based chatbot built with **Streamlit** and **Cohere**, allowing users to upload various types of documents (e.g., PDFs, Word files, Excel sheets, etc.) and ask questions about their content. The chatbot provides concise and accurate responses based on the uploaded document. The app is exposed to the web using **Ngrok**.

---

## **Features**
- Supports multiple file types:
  - Text files (`.txt`)
  - PDF files (`.pdf`)
  - Microsoft Word files (`.docx`)
  - Excel files (`.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.csv`)
  - PowerPoint presentations (`.pptx`)
  - Image files (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.tiff`)
- Uses the **Cohere API** to generate accurate answers to user queries.
- Exposed to the internet via **Ngrok** for easy sharing.

## **Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git
cd your-repository-name
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**
Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. **Add API Keys**
- Create a new file named `config.py` in the root directory.
- Add your API keys to the file as shown below:
```python
# config.py

config = {
    "COHERE_API_KEY": "your-cohere-api-key",
    "NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN": "your-ngrok-auth-token"
}
```

### 4. **Run the Application**
Start the Streamlit app using:
```bash
python app.py
```

### 5. **Access the App**
The app will generate a public URL using Ngrok. Look for output like:
```
Streamlit app is live at: https://<your-ngrok-url>.ngrok.io
```
Open the URL in your web browser.
